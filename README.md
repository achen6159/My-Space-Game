## Object of this game

You need to kill all of the mobs before they touch the bottom and destroy you. The enemies of the universe have decided to chase you down and they sent their mobs to attack (they each take 3 shots to hit). The mobs closest to you (green mobs) give you 100 points while the mobs above them (blue mobs) give you 150 points. You can also kill the UFO for extra points (200).
