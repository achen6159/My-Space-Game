# My-Space-Game

## Object of this game

You need to kill all of the mobs before they touch the bottom and destroy you. The enemies of the universe have decided to chase you down and they sent their mobs to attack (they each take 3 shots to hit). The mobs closest to you (green mobs) give you 100 points while the mobs above them (blue mobs) give you 150 points. You can also kill the UFO for extra points (200 points). 

## How to play

2. You will see a beginning screen.
2. Press the SPACE bar to start. 
3. Keep pressing the SPACE bar to shoot at the mobs and UFO, and the arrow keys to move your player around. 
4. Once you have killed all of the mobs, the game will end. 
5. If you weren't able to kill all of the mobs and they reach the bottom and touch you, the game will also end. 
6. If you lost all three lives which is represented as the shields, the game will also end.
